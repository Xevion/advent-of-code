Advent of Code Source Code

This repository will simply contain source code (possibly for multiple languages if I decide) for any and all problems I solve on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

I don't know currently how I'll be organizing everything, but I'll try and support multiple languages, and possibly *multiple years* (this is on the assumption that multiple years are in circulation on the site, since it's marked with **2018**).
